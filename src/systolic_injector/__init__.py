    Very important NOTE: N1, N2 and N3 are parameters for the instantiation of the systolic array design. These params
    correspond to the sizes of the matrices to multiply. Specifically, assuming C = A x B:
        - N1 is the number of ROWS of matrix A (which will be the rows of matrix C),
        - N2 is the number of COLUMNS of matrix B (which will be the columns of matrix C),
        - N3 is the number of COLUMNS of matrix A and the number of ROWS of matrix B.
    That is because we are gonna use the systolic array to perform matrix multiplication! 
    Another minor thing is: the shape of the transformed lowerings are bi-dimensional, since we are doing matrix
    multiplication, so we use the indexes defined in lowerings.py instead of the indexes defined in utils
