Systolic Array Framework for Fault Injection and Robust Accelerators


The library resides into the systolic_injector directory.
A simple test with a convolution and a matrix multiplication can be found in test.py.
A sample injection is provided.

Furthremore, a prototype for the visualization of the equations is given in systolic_visualization.py

**TODO**:

- [ ] implement im2col and zeroPadding as generally as possible
- [ ] formalize the injection process
