**F**aulty **L**ogic **A**ssessment **U**nit for **E**nhancing **R**eliability of **S**ystolic systems

Flauers (pronouced as "flowers") is a tool for simulating Systolic Systems.
Currently only matrix multiplicators are supported. 

The library resides into the systolic_injector directory.
A simple test with a convolution and a matrix multiplication can be found in test.py.
A sample injection is provided.

Furthremore, a prototype for the visualization of the equations is given in systolic_visualization.py
